CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS log_record ( /*
The LogRecord has a number of attributes, most of which are derived from the parameters to the constructor. (Note that the names do not always correspond exactly between the LogRecord constructor parameters and the LogRecord attributes.) These attributes can be used to merge data from the record into the format string. The following table lists (in alphabetical order) the attribute names, their meanings and the corresponding placeholder in a %-style format string.

If you are using {}-formatting (str.format()), you can use {attrname} as the placeholder in the format string. If you are using $-formatting (string.Template), use the form ${attrname}. In both cases, of course, replace attrname with the actual attribute name you want to use.

In the case of {}-formatting, you can specify formatting flags by placing them after the attribute name, separated from it with a colon. For example: a placeholder of {msecs:03.0f} would format a millisecond value of 4 as 004. Refer to the str.format() documentation for full details on the options available to you.
